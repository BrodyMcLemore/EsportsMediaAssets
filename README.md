# EsportsMediaAssets
>A central Repo to store all of the BVU Esports Streaming and Media Assets.

## Folders
### Clips
The Clips folder is a archive for all clips that have been posted.
The clips will **NOT** have any information tagged with them, as this information can be found on the Esports Notion page.

### Media
The Media folder stores all media assets used in streaming and social media.
This is the cloud repo for all images, stingers, logos, designs, and video files.
These files will have a basic description tagged with the file for searchability.

### Other
The Other folder is a grab bag for all other files and information need to properly run the Esports streams and social media accounts.
